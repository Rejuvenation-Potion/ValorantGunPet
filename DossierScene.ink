[Alpha Earth: VALORANT Protocol Headquarters]

Today marks the end of your first month out of training working in the Mission Control department at HQ. As you're about to exit the building a young man wearing fatigues calls out to you, "Wait!" he yells. He's been running for quite some time, "The higher-ups! You've got an assignment!" He catches his breath as he nears you, "Here, it's all on there." He shoves a tablet into your hands. You have an assignment? But it's only your first week! "Well? Open it! It's an emergency!" Your sweaty fingers suddenly become a nuisance as you scramble to hold the device upright. The young man nosily leans over your shoulder, "What kind of mission do they give a newbie anyway?"
* [Shove him away.] You shove him off of you, "Hey this is classified! Probably..." He gives you a look of disappointment before slinking away. You refocus your attention, and excitement, to the device. -> dossier_signin
* [Look through the mission dossier.] His presence doesn't bother you. Besides, if you were in his shoes you'd be curious too! You refocus your attention, and excitement, to the device. -> dossier_signin

TODO: Amaya: transition to next section. getting into communication with the field team at mission control
// quick outline: go to mission control department. "tap into" field agents on mission. make contact with agents, they each have something to say. brimstone is happy to hear from you. the agents have just entered the site through a portable gateway. you look through their cameras and mics. the facility is shutdown, all power appears to be cut. it should be easy getting inside. the agents easily infiltrate the main building, there is no resistance or guards. their goal is to get to the security room where they can access information, and get their comms restablished with Reyna. The main room is lit up with emergency lights that are independently powered. giant crates are lined up at the back of the room near a large metal door that leads to the main security system. 
You rush to the Mission Control department. Waiting impatiently is your department lead, "I don't know why they put a rookie on this but there's no time to lose. Come with me." He guides you to an Active Mission Operator desk. It buzzes with energy as you sit down. Your lead hands you a special helmet connected to the department's supercomputer, "Put this on and say '()'." You carefully put on the helmet and everything goes dark. The bustling noises of work are silenced and all light vanishes.
* "()"
- You gasp for air as all the color in the world lights up before you, swirling and zipping past you. You begin to feel nauseous just as the colors start to settle. You push away the feeling and focus on the images before you. Three perspectives seen at once. And then the sound comes. Metal and wind, the road, the sounds of people breathing. A digital overlay appears before you, labeling the perspectives and analyzing the environment.

    [Location: VALORANT Protocol, Portable Pathway Vehicle]
"It seems we're no longer alone," Viper says. Brimstone looks up to a pale woman with short black hair, then to a blinking light on his bracer, "Ah! That would be our IO. How ya doing kid?" He grins and waits for you to answer.
* "Intelligence Officer {player_name} requesting status report[."]," you say dutifully. "Straight to business, alright," Brimstone shakes his head, "We've already made the jump to Omega and the facility should be close by. Our sources say that this place was recently abandoned. Expect it to be lightly guarded. All we gotta do is get in, get out, and boom! Mission accomplished." 
* "Doing great, thank you sir! I'm ready for the mission, sir!"[] You say eagerly, letting slip your exitment.
* "Oh just amazing. My conscious was shot through a dimension-portal link for the first time and I managed NOT to throw up!" [] You say in a sarcastic but playful tone. Killjoy, a young woman in colorful clothing and a green beenie, chuckles at your joke, "I like this one, they've got 'spunk' as you Americans say." Viper groans, which only causes Killjoy to smile wider.
- Suddenly the vehicle comes to a screeching stop.
